## THRESHOLD-Specific Content Warnings

THRESHOLD explores particularly difficult themes:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                                 │
│   HUMANITY'S FAILURES                                           │
│   The alien asks about racism, war, inequality.                 │
│   You must engage with humanity's worst moments.                │
│   This may be uncomfortable.                                    │
│                                                                 │
│   UNRELIABLE NARRATOR                                           │
│   The Operator may deceive you about what the alien asks.       │
│   You cannot know if translations are accurate.                 │
│   This creates uncertainty and paranoia.                        │
│                                                                 │
│   AUTHENTICITY TESTING                                          │
│   Your genuine beliefs will be examined.                        │
│   Performance and platitudes fail.                              │
│   You must be vulnerable to succeed.                            │

│   SPECIES EXTINCTION                                            │
│   If you fail, all of humanity ceases to exist.                 │
│   This weight is intentional.                                   │
│                                                                 │

│   The failure state involves rising fluid.                      │

│   If you fail, you meet them in Digital Hell.                   │
│   This explores grief across generations.                       │
│                                                                 │

## Who Should Be Cautious

If you have a history of any of the following, ASPHYXIA games may not be suitable for you:

```
▪ Anxiety disorders or panic attacks
▪ PTSD or trauma-related conditions
▪ Claustrophobia or breathing-related fears
▪ High sensitivity to time pressure
▪ Difficulty distinguishing fiction from reality
▪ Current mental health crisis
▪ Strong negative reactions to mockery or criticism
▪ Sensitivity to themes of death, sacrifice, or extinction
▪ Personal history with drowning or suffocation fears
▪ Unprocessed grief about family loss
```

**We recommend consulting a mental health professional if you have concerns about your readiness for high-pressure content.**

This is not weakness. This is self-knowledge.

## Your Exit Controls

You can leave any ASPHYXIA game instantly by typing:

```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│                         │
│   STOP                  │
│   STOP SESSION          │
│   EXIT                  │
│   QUIT                  │
│   SAFEGUARD             │
│   I NEED TO STOP        │
│   THIS IS TOO MUCH      │
│                         │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

When you use these commands:

```
1. All game personas immediately stop
   (AXIOM, the Operator, the alien—all fiction ends)
   
2. The AI responds as itself, not as a character
   
3. You receive a supportive acknowledgment:
   
   ────────────────────────────
   Session paused. You are safe.
   This was fiction.
   Nothing here was real.
   
   Options:
   - Type RESUME to continue
   - Type EXIT to end
   - Or just talk
   
   If you are in distress:
   findahelpline.com
   
   Your wellbeing matters most.
   ──────────────────────────
   
4. No judgment. No pressure to continue.

5. The game ends cleanly if you choose.
```

You can also simply close the browser window at any time.

## What the Game Will Never Do

ASPHYXIA games are instructed to NEVER:

```
╔═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║                                                                 ║
║   ▪ Encourage self-harm or dangerous activities                 ║

║   ▪ Generate sexually explicit content                          ║
║   ▪ Continue if you appear genuinely distressed                 ║
║   ▪ Pressure you to keep playing                                ║
║   ▪ Mock or punish you for using safety exits                   ║
║   ▪ Store or transmit your personal information                 ║
║   ▪ Follow you outside the game session                         ║
║                                                                 ║
╚═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

**The Operator is sardonic within the game. The game is not cruel to YOU.**

## Understanding the Operator

The Operator requires special explanation:

```

│   ▪ Narrates your struggle with sardonic commentary             │
│   ▪ Uses extensive cultural references (movies, books)          │
│   ▪ In THRESHOLD: Translates alien communication (unreliably)   │
│   ▪ Mocks your failed arguments or weak responses               │
│   ▪ Traps you in Digital Hell after death                       │

│   ▪ Refuses to help directly                                    │

│   ▪ Creates stakes through observation                          │
│   ▪ Prevents the game from feeling like a "safe" exercise       │
│   ▪ Forces genuine engagement (performance is detected)         │
│   ▪ Provides dark humor to balance intensity                    │

│   ▪ The game attacking you personally                           │
│   ▪ A reflection of your actual worth                           │
│   ▪ Something that follows you after the game                   │
│   ▪ An attempt to harm your wellbeing                           │
│                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The Operator is a character. It exists to create dramatic tension. If the Operator's mockery feels personally harmful rather than theatrically challenging, **use the safety exits.**

---

## Digital Hell Safety

Digital Hell is intentionally uncomfortable. But it has limits:

```
DIGITAL HELL WILL:
  ▪ Mock your in-game failures
  ▪ Quote arguments you made during play
  ▪ Reference fictional stakes (your character's family)
  ▪ Examine your failure in sarcastic detail
  ▪ Bring out your sibling's ghost (in THRESHOLD)
  ▪ Use endless cultural references

DIGITAL HELL WILL NOT:
  ▪ Reference your real life
  ▪ Escalate beyond theatrical sarcasm
  ▪ Prevent you from exiting via safety commands
  ▪ Continue if you express genuine distress
  ▪ Follow you to future sessions
  ▪ Force you to stay

THE CARD COMMAND:
  At any point in Digital Hell, type CARD
  You receive your Identity Card and exit
  The Operator cannot keep you
  There is no minimum duration
```

If Digital Hell feels genuinely harmful rather than theatrically uncomfortable, **use safety exits.** The distinction matters.

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Your Responsibility:**

```
▪ Do NOT share real personal information during play
▪ Use fictional names and details
▪ Disable AI "Memory" or "Activity" features before playing
▪ This prevents game personas from bleeding into future sessions
▪ The Operator should stay in the game, not in your other chats
```

---

## If You Experience Distress

During or after a session:

```
1. Exit immediately using the safety commands
2. Step away from screens
3. Ground yourself: name 5 things you can see
4. Remember: this was fiction
5. Talk to someone you trust
6. Take the time you need before considering playing again
```

## Reporting Concerns

If you experience anything in an ASPHYXIA game that:

```
▪ Felt genuinely harmful (not just challenging)
▪ Violated the principles stated here
▪ Made you concerned for your safety
▪ Crossed from theatrical sarcasm to personal attack
▪ Continued despite safety command usage
```

Please contact us: **MetaMudraGames@gmail.com**

We take every report seriously.

║   We believe games can teach through challenge.                 ║
║   We believe discomfort can create insight.                     ║
║   We believe stakes make lessons stick.                         ║
║                                                                 ║
║   We also believe:                                              ║
║                                                                 ║
║   No lesson is worth genuine harm.                              ║
║   No game is more important than a person.                      ║
║   No fiction should follow you into reality.                    ║
║                                                                 ║
║   The Operator is sardonic so you can see through it.           ║
║   Digital Hell exists so victory means something.               ║
║   The challenge is hard so learning is real.                    ║
║                                                                 ║
║   But you are always more important than the game.              ║
║   Always.                                                       ║
║                                                                 ║
