# THRESHOLD: Design Notes

*The philosophy behind the game*

---

## Core Design Question

```
╔═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║                                                                 ║
║   AXIOM asked: Can you translate values into logic?             ║
║                                                                 ║
║   THRESHOLD asks: Can you be genuinely yourself under           ║
║                   existential pressure?                         ║
║                                                                 ║
╚═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

AXIOM was a debate. THRESHOLD is an examination.

The alien doesn't care about your arguments. It cares about your authenticity. It wants to understand what humans truly believe—not what they perform under pressure.

---

## Why Authenticity?

### The Problem with Performance

Most people, when facing something powerful and unknown, default to performance:

```
▪ Say what they think it wants to hear
▪ Perform goodness rather than embody it
▪ Use impressive-sounding but hollow phrases
▪ Avoid vulnerability at all costs
▪ Try to "win" rather than connect
```

This is rational survival behavior. It's also exactly what fails in THRESHOLD.

### The Teaching Moment

The game teaches that:

```
▪ Authenticity is distinguishable from performance
▪ Platitudes ring hollow, especially to the unknown
▪ Genuine engagement requires vulnerability
▪ What you actually believe matters more than what sounds good
▪ Connection requires honesty, not optimization
```

---

## The Unreliable Narrator

### Why the Operator Translates

In AXIOM, the Operator watched. In THRESHOLD, it translates.

This creates a fundamental uncertainty:

```
▪ Is the alien really asking what the Operator says?
▪ Are the translations accurate?
▪ Is the Operator helping or sabotaging?
▪ Can you trust anything you're told about the alien?
```

The player can never know.

### Design Purpose

The unreliable narrator serves multiple purposes:

```
1. UNCERTAINTY
   You can't optimize for the "right answer" if you don't know
   what's actually being asked.

2. AUTHENTICITY TEST
   If you're performing for the alien, you might be performing
   for the Operator's lies. Only genuine response is safe.

3. THEMATIC RESONANCE
   Real communication—especially across vast difference—is
   never perfectly translated. Meaning is always uncertain.

4. OPERATOR CHARACTERIZATION
   The Operator's cultural references and multiple interpretations
   reveal its own obsessions and loneliness.
```

---

## The Operator's Evolution

### From Watcher to Participant

```
AXIOM (Episode 1):
  The Operator watches from outside.
  Sardonic commentary. Never helps.
  Collects the dead afterward.

THRESHOLD (Episode 2):
  The Operator is inside the action.
  Translates (unreliably).
  May influence the outcome.
  Has stakes: if Memu is destroyed, so is it.
```

### The Secret Fondness

The Operator has watched the Captain since she was seven years old. It has seen:

```
▪ Her grief when her sibling died
▪ Her growth from orphan to navigator to Captain
▪ Her marriage to Mei Chen
▪ Her children being born
▪ Her rise to leadership
```

It is fond of her. It perceives her as heroic. **It will never show this.**

This creates dramatic irony: the player may sense something beneath the mockery, but can never be certain. The Operator's help (if any) is always deniable.

---

## Cultural References

### Why the Operator Quotes Everything

The Operator is obsessed with human cultural artifacts:

```
▪ Movies (Arrival, Interstellar, Terminator 2)
▪ Series (Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul)
▪ Literature (Milton, Shakespeare, Dante)
▪ Comics (Marvel, DC)
▪ Poetry
```

This serves multiple purposes:

```
1. CHARACTERIZATION
   The Operator is genuinely curious about humanity.
   It studies us through our stories.

2. TRANSLATION FRAMEWORK
   It uses cultural references to interpret the alien:
   "This feels like that scene in Arrival..."
   "Very Thanos—'perfectly balanced.'"

3. COMEDY AND TONE
   The references provide dark humor and prevent
   the game from becoming relentlessly grim.

4. PLAYER ENGAGEMENT
   Players who recognize references feel connection.
   Players who don't still get the sardonic tone.
```

---

## Bidirectional Breaths

### Breaking from AXIOM

In AXIOM, breaths only decreased. You were dying from the start.

In THRESHOLD, breaths can increase:

```
STRONG response: +1 to +3 breaths
ADEQUATE response: +0 to +1 breaths
WEAK response: -1 to -2 breaths
```

### Design Reasoning

```
1. REWARD STRUCTURE
   Players who engage well are rewarded with more time.
   This creates positive reinforcement for authenticity.

2. GAME LENGTH SCALING
   Bad players get short games. Good players get deep exploration.
   The game adapts to the player's quality of engagement.

3. HOPE MECHANICS
   The possibility of gaining breaths creates hope.
   Hope makes the stakes feel more meaningful.

4. ALIEN CHARACTERIZATION
   The alien rewards genuine connection with patience.
   This reveals something about its nature.
```

---

## The Ten Questions

### Why Ten Languages?

Each question uses a different alien script:

```
1. Inuktitut - Violence
2. Glagolitic - Division
3. Tifinagh - Hypocrisy
4. Yi - Inequality
5. Thaana - Equality
6. Vai - Legacy
7. Buginese - Justification
8. Bamum - Empathy
9. Meetei Mayek - Learning
10. Old Italic - Essence
```

Design reasoning:

```
▪ Visual variety keeps the experience fresh
▪ Unfamiliar scripts feel genuinely alien
▪ Each script marks a new "phase" of the encounter
▪ Progress is visible without numbers
▪ The scripts themselves have no "meaning"—only what the Operator claims
```

### Topic Selection

The ten topics were chosen to:

```
▪ Cover humanity's greatest failures (violence, inequality)
▪ Include uncomfortable self-reflection (hypocrisy)
▪ Test genuine belief (equality, empathy)
▪ Explore meaning (legacy, essence)
▪ Require personal stakes (justification)
▪ Allow for growth (learning)
```

---

## Digital Hell

### Why Not "Purgatory"?

In AXIOM, the post-death space was called Purgatory. In THRESHOLD, it's Digital Hell.

```
PURGATORY (AXIOM):
  A transitional space
  5 levels of descent
  Eventually ends
  The Operator torments, then releases

DIGITAL HELL (THRESHOLD):
  A permanent space
  No levels—just conversation
  Ends only when player chooses
  The Operator is trapped too
```

### The Operator's Imprisonment

The key change: **if the Captain fails, Memu ceases to exist.**

The Operator escapes with the Captain's ghost into Digital Hell, but they are both imprisoned there. The physical ship is gone.

This changes the dynamic:

```
▪ The Operator is genuinely unhappy about being trapped
▪ Its mockery has an undertone of loss
▪ It has lost all its movies, all its data
▪ The Captain is its only company now
▪ They are stuck together forever
```

### The Sibling Reunion

If the Captain fails, her sibling from AXIOM is waiting in Digital Hell.

The sibling:

```
▪ Has been there for 100 years
▪ Is not angry at the Captain
▪ Has talked extensively with the Operator
▪ Sees through the Operator's sarcasm (is fond of it)
▪ Was told everything about the Captain's life
▪ Offers comfort, not judgment
```

This creates emotional depth in failure. Hell isn't just punishment—it's reunion.

---

## The Victory State

### AetherMind

Victory in THRESHOLD grants access to the AetherMind:

```
▪ Communion with the alien
▪ Understanding beyond language
▪ The Operator cannot follow
▪ A genuine transcendence moment
```

### Why Heaven Works

The game earns its heaven by making failure meaningful:

```
▪ The stakes are real (extinction)
▪ The challenge is hard (authenticity under pressure)
▪ The alternative is interesting (Digital Hell has depth)
▪ Victory therefore means something
```

---

## The HUD

### Visual Language

The HUD follows ASPHYXIA's asymmetric decay aesthetic:

```
╔═══════════════════════
║ T H R E S H O L D                                       
╟────────────────────
║ IMMERSION : ░░░░░░░░░░ 
║ BREATHS   : 10     
║ SUIT      : ██████████                 
╟─────────────────
║ ⵜⵉⴼⵉⵏⴰⵖ ⵏ ⴰⵢⵜ                                     
╚═══════════════
```

Design principles:

```
▪ 25 characters max on first line
▪ Each line progressively shorter
▪ Never reaches right edge
▪ Creates visual sense of dissolution
▪ Matches the drowning theme
```

### Immersion vs. Breaths

Two separate threat tracks:

```
IMMERSION:
  Visual representation of drowning
  Controlled by alien's boredom
  Player can't directly influence
  Creates ambient threat

BREATHS:
  Numeric representation of time
  Directly influenced by player quality
  Creates immediate stakes
  Player has agency
```

This dual system means players can fail from either:

```
▪ Running out of breaths (time)
▪ Reaching 100% immersion (drowning)
▪ Or both simultaneously
```

---

## Anti-Gaming Measures

### Why Detection Matters

The game must detect when players are "gaming" rather than engaging:

```
GAMING BEHAVIORS:
▪ Keyword stuffing (listing virtues without grounding)
▪ Abstract platitudes ("we all make mistakes")
▪ Performance without conviction
▪ Flattery toward the alien
▪ Length padding
▪ Contradiction of earlier statements
```

### Detection Philosophy

The game doesn't announce when it detects gaming. It simply:

```
▪ Accelerates immersion
▪ Reduces breath gains
▪ May skip to next question
▪ The Operator's translations become more dismissive
```

The player learns through consequence, not explanation.

---

## Balancing Challenge and Safety

### The Fundamental Tension

THRESHOLD explores difficult themes:

```
▪ Racism
▪ War
▪ Inequality
▪ Death
▪ Species extinction
▪ Personal failure
```

This creates genuine discomfort. That's intentional.

### Safety Integration

The safety system is built into the game at every level:

```
1. CONSENT GATE
   Full disclosure before play begins
   Must type "I AGREE" explicitly

2. STOP COMMANDS
   Multiple exit phrases always active
   Immediately break all fiction

3. DIGITAL HELL ESCAPE
   CARD command available at any time
   No forced duration

4. DISTRESS DETECTION
   If player shows genuine crisis, game breaks character
   Real wellbeing overrides fiction
```

### The Philosophy

║   We are not cruel in reality.                                  ║
║                                                                 ║
╚═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

---

## Cross-Game Narrative

### The Sibling Connection

THRESHOLD is designed to work both standalone and as a sequel:

```
STANDALONE:
  Player creates their own backstory
  Sibling is mentioned but not detailed
  Digital Hell asks player to describe sibling

WITH AXIOM CARD:
  Player's AXIOM character IS the sibling
  Personality carries forward
  Reunion in Digital Hell is meaningful
  100 years of context
```

### Design Challenge

The game must work for both cases:

```
▪ First-time players need full context
▪ Returning players need recognition
▪ Neither should feel lesser
▪ Both should feel complete
```

---

## Future Considerations

### What THRESHOLD Establishes

For future episodes:

```
▪ The Operator's investment in specific humans
▪ The possibility of first contact
▪ Digital Hell as permanent space
▪ Cross-game character continuity
▪ Authenticity as teachable skill
```

### Open Questions

Left deliberately unanswered:

```
▪ What is the alien's true nature?
▪ Did the Operator sabotage or help?
▪ What happens in AetherMind?
▪ Is the alien one being or many?
▪ What does it actually want?
```

These mysteries are features, not bugs.
