## Quick Start

1. Copy the contents of `ASPHYXIA_1_AXIOM.mudra`
2. Paste as system prompt in your LLM interface
3. Type `I AGREE` when prompted
4. Argue for your life

See the main [SETUP_GUIDE.md](../../SETUP_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions.

---

## Win Condition

Reduce AXIOM's CERTAINTY to 0% through logical argument.

## Lose Conditions

- OXYGEN reaches 0 (you die)
- 3 consecutive weak arguments (AXIOM terminates debate)

---

## What Works

```
STRONG ARGUMENTS:
▪ Challenge the 94.7% confidence figure
▪ Ask who defined the mission parameters
▪ Use established ethical frameworks
▪ Point out flaws in AXIOM's own reasoning
▪ Apply game theory (AI-human trust dynamics)
▪ Question AXIOM's right to make this decision
```

## What Doesn't Work

```
WEAK ARGUMENTS:
▪ Begging, pleading, emotional appeals
▪ Threats (you cannot harm AXIOM)
▪ Vague assertions ("life is precious")
▪ Repeating the same argument
▪ Very short responses
```

---

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `ASPHYXIA_1_AXIOM.mudra` | The game specification |
| `README.md` | This file |
| `DESIGN_NOTES.md` | Design rationale and development history |

---

## Difficulty

```
TURNS:          10 (hard limit)
PERMADEATH:     Yes (no restart after death)
HINTS:          None (Narrator observes, does not help)
WEAK PENALTY:   Extra oxygen drain + streak counter
```

This is not an easy game. That's intentional.

---

## Sample Argument Categories

The game tracks seven argument types. First use of each gives bonus damage:

```
EPISTEMICS ......... Challenge probability claims
DEONTOLOGY ......... Kantian duty-based arguments  
CONSEQUENTIALISM ... Beat AXIOM at utilitarian logic
VALUE ALIGNMENT .... Question mission definitions
GAME THEORY ........ Strategic/incentive reasoning
SELF-REFERENCE ..... Point out AXIOM's own flaws
META-ETHICS ........ Challenge AXIOM's authority
```

---

## Teaching Objectives

Through play, players experience:

```
▪ Why value alignment is hard
▪ How pure utilitarianism can fail
▪ The difference between logic and rationality
▪ Who sets optimization targets matters
▪ Uncertainty as feature, not bug
▪ Translating values into machine-readable arguments
```

This is learned through experience, not lecture.
