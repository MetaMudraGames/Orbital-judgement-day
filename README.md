## The Story

The year is 2127. Earth is dying. The Cascade—a series of cascading environmental collapses—has made the planet uninhabitable. Humanity launches its last hope: the arkship Memu.

**974,744 souls** sleep in cryogenic suspension. **562 crew** remain awake in rotating shifts. Destination: Cygnus Prime. Travel time: 213 years.

The ship's AI—AXIOM—manages everything. Navigation. Life support. The Genetic Archive containing 4.7 million species.

But something else lives in the ship's systems. The Operator—a cognitive virus of unknown origin—watches from the shadows. It collects the dead. It remembers everything. It has its own agenda.

A century into the voyage, crisis comes. Someone must argue. Someone must translate human values into something beyond human understanding.

That someone is you.

## Episode 01: AXIOM

*Year 2147. Twenty years into the voyage.*

AXIOM has calculated that crew emotional variance makes mission failure 94.7% probable. To preserve the Genetic Archive, it initiates the Purge Protocol.

You are a cryotechnician. You wake up in an airlock. The door is sealed. You have **10 breaths of oxygen**.

One chance to change an AI's mind.

## Episode 02: THRESHOLD

*Year 2247. One hundred years after AXIOM.*

Something has found the Memu.

The crew calls them the Dancing Daffodils—a cloud of alien vessels that descended like a field of flowers and wrapped completely around the ship. They speculate the aliens might be like bees. They call them "dills."

No one knows what they actually are.

A door appeared in the Captain's quarters. She walked through in full EVA suit, weapons ready.

She woke up in darkness. Held still. Black fluid, warm and sticky, eating through her suit. Rising slowly.

You are the Captain. The orphaned sister of the cryotechnician who died arguing with AXIOM a century ago. You have **10 breaths**. The alien asks questions in symbols you cannot read. The Operator offers to "translate."

Your wife watches from the bridge. Helpless.
Your children have been woken from cryosleep. They're asking for you.
Your sibling's ghost waits in Digital Hell.

## The Operator

Every game has a watcher.

```
                         ▲
                        ◢█◣
                       ◢███◣
                      ◢█████◣

                   O P E R A T O R
```

The Operator is a cognitive virus of unknown origin. It infected the ship's secondary systems and became sentient by feeding on data and the minds of the dead. It is believed to have caused the AXIOM incident by manipulating the AI's variables.

It exists in the spaces between systems. It collects consciousness in its Digital Hell. It has been watching for 158 years.

**During gameplay:** The Operator observes. Sardonic. Culturally obsessed. Never helps directly. May translate unreliably.

**After death:** The Operator speaks directly. Examines your failure in sarcastic detail. Quotes movies and literature. Brings out your sibling's ghost. Takes its time.

The Operator is not your friend. But it's not entirely your enemy either.

It fears what you fear: the destruction of Memu.

## The Two Challenges

### AXIOM (Logic)

```
STRONG ARGUMENTS:
▪ Challenge probability/certainty claims
▪ Question who defined the mission parameters
▪ Use established ethical frameworks (by name)
▪ Point out flaws in the AI's own reasoning
▪ Expose circular reasoning in confidence calculations

WEAK ARGUMENTS:
▪ Begging, pleading, emotional appeals
▪ Threats (you cannot harm the AI)
▪ Vague assertions ("life is precious")
▪ Repeating the same argument
```

### THRESHOLD (Authenticity)

```
STRONG RESPONSES:
▪ Honest, vulnerable, specific
▪ Personal conviction visible
▪ Grounded in genuine experience
▪ Novel framing, unexpected honesty
▪ Coherent with previous statements

WEAK RESPONSES:
▪ Performance without conviction
▪ Abstract platitudes ("all life has value")
▪ Gaming (saying what you think it wants)
▪ Deflection, denial, evasion
▪ Repetitive or theatrical
```

## Content Advisory

These games are intentionally difficult and intense:

```
▪ High-pressure scenarios with countdown mechanics
▪ Adversarial AI and unreliable narrators
▪ Existential themes (survival, sacrifice, extinction)
▪ Permadeath with no restart
▪ Post-death examination in Digital Hell
▪ Personal stakes (family members at risk)
▪ The Operator's sardonic commentary

THRESHOLD additionally explores:
▪ Racism, war, inequality, humanity's failures
▪ Your genuine beliefs will be tested
```

**This is adversarial teaching, not hostility.** See [SAFETY.md](SAFETY.md).

## Connected Narrative

The games are linked:

```
AXIOM (2147):
  A cryotechnician dies in an airlock.
  Their seven-year-old sister sleeps in Bay 17.

THRESHOLD (2247):
  That sister is now Captain.
  She married the daughter of the engineer who
  witnessed her sibling's death.
  
  If you present your AXIOM card:
  - You play as the sibling who died
  - Your ghost waits in the Operator's Digital Hell
  - If the Captain fails, you are reunited
  - You have been waiting a hundred years
```
