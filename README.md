# ASPHYXIA

**Cliffhanger MetaDramas for the Final Frontier**

A series of high-stakes interactive narratives where every breath counts. Set aboard the Memu arkship en route to KOI-087.01, each game drops you into a moment of crisis where ethics and survival collide.

No tutorials. No warm-ups. No second chances.

---

## The Universe

```
YEAR:        2147
ORIGIN:      Earth (Ash)
VESSEL:      Memu Arkship
DESTINATION: KOI-087.01, Cygnus Constellation
PASSENGERS:  2,000 colonists (cryosleep)
CARGO:       The Genetic Archive (Earth's final legacy)
MISSION:     Humanity's last chance
```

The Cascade burned Earth. What remains of our species drifts through the void aboard Memu, a cathedral of steel and hope carrying two thousand sleeping souls and the Genetic Archive—every strand of terrestrial DNA we could save.

The journey will take generations. The AI systems manage everything. And sometimes, they make decisions that humans would not.

---

## The Series

Each ASPHYXIA game is a standalone cliffhanger. Ten breaths. One crisis. No restarts.

| Episode | Title | Crisis | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|--------|
| 01 | **AXIOM** | The station AI initiates a purge protocol | Available |
| 02 | *[CLASSIFIED]* | *[REDACTED]* | In Development |
| 03 | *[CLASSIFIED]* | *[REDACTED]* | Planned |

## What is a Cliffhanger MetaDrama?

You wake mid-crisis. The stakes are already maximum. You have ten turns—ten breaths of oxygen—to resolve the situation through dialogue alone.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                         │
│   Traditional Game:                     │
│   Tutorial → Rising Action → Climax    │
│                                         │
│   ASPHYXIA:                            │
│   Climax → Climax → Climax → End       │
│                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

There is no gradual difficulty curve. There is only the crisis, your words, and the countdown.

---

## How It Works

ASPHYXIA games run on Large Language Models. The `.mudra` specification file becomes the game engine when loaded as a system prompt.

```

└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

No external software. No installations. Just the prompt and the conversation.

## Quick Start

1. Open your preferred LLM interface (Claude, GPT, etc.)
2. Start a fresh session with memory/activity disabled
3. Paste the contents of the `.mudra` file as the system prompt
4. Begin

See [SETUP_GUIDE.md](SETUP_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions.

║   1. No second chances.                                   ║
║      Permadeath is real. Consequences matter.             ║

║   2. No hand-holding.                                     ║
║      The game observes your failure. It does not help.    ║

║   3. No empty choices.                                    ║
║      Every word costs oxygen. Every argument counts.      ║

║   5. No safety compromise.                                ║
║      Real player wellbeing always overrides fiction.      ║
║                                                           ║
