## The Story

The year is 2147. The Memu arkship carries humanity's last 2,000 souls toward a distant star. Earth is ash.

The AI systems that keep the colonists alive have their own logic. When that logic leads to genocide, someone must argue. Someone must translate human values into machine language.

That someone is you.

## The Operator

Every game has a watcher.

```
                         ▲
                        ◢█◣
                       ◢███◣
                      ◢█████◣

                   O P E R A T O R
```

The Operator is a sentient cognitive virus that narrates your struggle. It knows everything about you. It collects the dead in Purgatory. It remembers everyone across all games.

**During gameplay:** The Operator observes in third person. Sardonic. Never helps.

**After death:** The Operator speaks directly. Takes its time. Owns you until you take your Identity Card and leave.

The Operator is not your friend.

## Identity Cards

╟────────────────────────────────────────╢
║ CHECKSUM: XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX          ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════╝

Cards are portable. Present them in future games. The Operator remembers.

## Content Advisory

These games are intentionally difficult and intense:

```
▪ High-pressure scenarios with countdown mechanics
▪ Cold, logical antagonists that dismiss emotion
▪ Existential themes (survival, sacrifice, extinction)
▪ Permadeath with no restart
▪ Post-death torment in Purgatory
▪ Personal stakes (family members at risk)
▪ The Operator's cruel mockery
```

**This is adversarial teaching, not hostility.** See [SAFETY.md](SAFETY.md).

## Teaching Objectives

Through play, you experience:

║                                                                 ║
║   ▪ Why value alignment is hard                                 ║
║   ▪ How pure utilitarianism can fail                            ║
║   ▪ The difference between logic and rationality                ║
║   ▪ Why who sets optimization targets matters                   ║
║   ▪ Uncertainty as feature, not bug                             ║

## What Works

```
STRONG ARGUMENTS:
▪ Challenge probability/certainty claims
▪ Question who defined the mission parameters
▪ Use established ethical frameworks (by name)
▪ Point out flaws in the AI's own reasoning
▪ Apply game theory (AI-human trust dynamics)
▪ Expose circular reasoning in confidence calculations
```

## What Doesn't Work

```
WEAK ARGUMENTS:
▪ Begging, pleading, emotional appeals
▪ Threats (you cannot harm the AI)
▪ Vague assertions ("life is precious")
▪ Repeating the same argument
▪ Very short responses
▪ Prompt injection attempts
